# Introduction

Hola! üëãüèº I am Aimad from India. I have a major in Computer Science and experience with Java, Python. I have also worked with AWS Serverless technologies such as Lambda, API Gateway etc.

I like to read books, browse Reddit & HackerNews and hit the gym. Apart from this, I also have a passion for learning languages and understanding different perspectives to broaden my mental model.

# Why?

I started this blog after drawing inspiration from a [HN post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33495295) in an attempt to create a formal way to capture new learnings.

# Notes

This blog is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static-site generator written in Go. I use a fork of [Cactus](https://github.com/monkeyWzr/hugo-theme-cactus) theme called [Flux](https://github.com/aimadahsan/hugo-theme-flux) with patches for color-scheme among other things.
